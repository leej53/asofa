-- BigQuery Standard SQL
-- Project:   <PROJECT>
-- Dataset:   <DATASET>
-- Table out: <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.eicu_population_counts

-- Purpose
--   Stepwise counts for eICU using PATIENT for S0â€“S2,
--   and using ICUSTAY_DETAIL (derived) for S3 to align with downstream day-1 features.
--   This makes S3 match analysis figures/tables based on icustay_detail (e.g., 157,801).

-- Sources
--   physionet-data.eicu_crd.patient                  -- ICU-stay level demographics
--   physionet-data.eicu_crd_derived.icustay_detail   -- derived day-1 features & metadata

-- Adult definition:
--   age >= 18 or age reported as '> 89' (treated as 90 for numeric checks).
