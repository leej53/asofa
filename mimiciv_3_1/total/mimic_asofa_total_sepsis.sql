-- File: mimic_asofa_total_sepsis.sql
-- BigQuery Standard SQL
-- Project:   <PROJECT>
-- Dataset:   <DATASET>
-- Table out: <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.mimic_asofa_total_sepsis
--
-- Purpose
--   Build the aSOFA vs SOFA total table for the *Sepsis-3 cohort* restricted to:
--     (1) septic on ICU admission, OR
--     (2) septic within the first 24 hours after ICU admission.
--   Cohort filtering now uses the two flags precomputed in <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.sepsis3
--   for full parity with the eICU pipeline.
--
-- Alignment & Dependencies
--   * Sepsis-3: <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.sepsis3
--       - adult (>=18y), FIRST ICU stay; Day-1 SOFA rebuild (custom CV rules)
--       - includes: sepsis3, suspected_infection_time, septic_on_admission, sepsis_within_24h  [ref]
--   * Suspicion-of-infection rule identical to the finalized approach
--     (abxâ€“culture timing windows). [ref]
--
-- Inputs (finalized domain tables; adult + first ICU stay already applied)
--   <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.mimic_asofa_cv
--   <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.mimic_asofa_resp
--   <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.mimic_asofa_renal
--   physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_derived.first_day_sofa  (SOFA coagulation & liver)
--   <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.sepsis3
--
-- Output columns (matched to mimic_asofa_total for consistency)
--   subject_id | stay_id
--   asofa_cv_score | sofa_cv_score
--   asofa_resp_score | sofa_resp_score
--   asofa_renal_score | sofa_renal_score
--   sofa_coag_score | sofa_liver_score
--   asofa_total_score | sofa_total_score
--   length_of_stay | mortality_30day
--
-- Notes
--   * Cohort = sepsis3=TRUE AND (septic_on_admission OR sepsis_within_24h) from sepsis3 table.
--   * Coagulation/liver subscores are taken from first_day_sofa (unchanged).
--   * LOS/mortality are taken from domain tables as in your released code.
