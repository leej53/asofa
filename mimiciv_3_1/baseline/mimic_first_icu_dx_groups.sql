-- Dataset:   <DATASET>
-- Table out: <PROJECT>.<DATASET>.mimic_first_icu_dx_groups
--
-- Purpose
--   Generate diagnosis group distributions for the MIMIC-IV v3.1 cohort,
--   restricted to each subjectâ€™s FIRST ICU admission (hadm_id).
--   Ten broad diagnostic categories are flagged based on ICD-9/ICD-10 codes.
--
-- Cohort
--   * Adult patients, first ICU stay per subject.
--   * Each HADM may map to multiple diagnosis groups (percentages may sum >100).
--
-- Diagnosis groups (flagged from diagnoses_icd):
--   1) Sepsis/Septic shock  (extended definition: ICD-10 organism-specified codes)
--   2) Respiratory failure / ARDS
--   3) Pneumonia
--   4) Acute myocardial infarction
--   5) Heart failure
--   6) Stroke / Intracranial hemorrhage
--   7) Acute kidney injury
--   8) COPD / Asthma
--   9) Trauma
--   10) Post-op / Surgical complications
--
-- Notes
--   * Sepsis ICD definitions (methods): ICD-9 038*, 99591, 99592, 78552;
--     ICD-10 A40*, A41*, R6520, R6521, A021, A227, A267, A327, A427.
--   * Percent denominators = total distinct subjects in the first ICU cohort.
--   * Table is GitHub-ready and aligned with other public MIMIC scripts.
